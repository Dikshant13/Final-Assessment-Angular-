    Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans
    or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly 
    used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible
     plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots,
      and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat 
      arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition.</p>
